About This Release
------------------


Changes:

    New library:
        SRFI-25 : Ported by Marco Maggi  (Issue 234)

    VM:
        BoehmGC was updated to upstream 7.3alpha.
        Note: Mosh now can link against system-shared libgc. See 'Build system'
        section below.

    Reader:
        Reader now accepts following R7RS syntaxes:
         - #u8(...) (was #vu8(...))
         - #\null   (was #\nul)
         - #\escape (was #\esc)
         - #true    (was #t)
         - #false   (was #f)

        Number reader now reads "1e2" as inexact. To read exact number using
        exponents, add exactness prefix like "#e1e2".

    R6RS:
        utf8->string and string->utf8 no longer converts CRLF into LF.

    R7RS small:
        A subset of R7RS small library is now included at (scheme base) and its 
        friends.

    TinyCLOS:
        A bool value next-method? available within method definition. See
        Issue 216 for details.

    nmosh:
        Vector constants now evaluate to themselves. ie.) Expander would 
        implicitly add a quote to a vector such as #(a b c).
        
        nmosh now uses shortened filename for cache/debug-info. The shortened
        filename will be prefixed with "@"(at).

        nmosh learned "turbocharge"(precompile every standard libraries)
        feature.
        nmosh -R option will activate precompiled archive.
        
         To update precompiled libraries:
          nmosh -T turbocharge

         To verify turbocharge works:
          nmosh -R --verbose

         To use applet with turbocharged libraries:
          nmosh -RT applet-name

         Warning: turbocharged cache will not automatically update; ie. you
         will have to update turbocharge when you installed new nmosh on your
         system.

        CMake option MOSH_PRELOAD_CORE will activate above for core libraries.

        NMOSH_CLICOLOR is now also work on Win32 console.

    Build system:
        configure script learned new option --with-system-bdwgc to build with
        system-installed BoehmGC. Note: this option disables cons pair object
        size optmization.

        Build system now require pkg-config to generate.

        nmosh CMake builds now can be compiled with VisualStudio 2012 RC.

        nmosh CMake builds now built with clang compiler on MacOS 10.7 or later.

        nmosh CMake builds now install "testmosh.bat" to test built nmosh.exe
        on Win32.

        nmosh CMake builds now recognizes GStreamer SDK on Windows. Get 
        GStreamer SDK from: http://docs.gstreamer.com/display/GstSDK/Home

        Autotools and CMake builds will install additional plugins (some shared
        objects suffixed with .mplg) for nmosh.

        Applied several tidy-up patches from barak. (Thanks!)

Bug fixes:

    Build system:
        (mosh mysql) and (mosh config) was not installed properly.

    Reader:
        Fixed Issue 221 reported and patched by David Banks:
            "."(period) was not treated as a delimiter. For example, "#t.#f"
            read as #t. 

    VM:
        VM Compiler error "[internal error] iform-count-size-upto: unknown
        iform tag:13" was fixed.

    Core:
        The pointer type was erroneously sized 32bit in 64-bit *BSD platforms.

    rnrs:
        Fixed Issue 215 reported by mrc.mgg:
            finite? and flfinite? were returned #t for NaNs.

        Fixed Issue 217 reported by David Banks:
            eqv? was returned #t for (eqv? 4.0 4)

            
        Fixed vector-map problem reported by Eduardo Cavazos:
            vector-map was not handle correctly when given procedure returned 
            multiple times. Now vector-map defined as vector variant of R6RS 
            map.

        Various procedures fixed for returning correct exact/inexact value.

        Fixed Issue 224 reported by David Banks:
            hashtable-ref could cause segfaults.

        Bytevector buffer port opened by open-bytevector-output-port was broken
        when the value outputted multiple times.

    FFI x86_64:
        No longer clobber rax register on calling FFI functions.
        This change made var-arg functions callable on x86_64.

    nmosh:
        On Win32, nmosh couldn't start properly on very long path(> 255 chars).

    nmosh r6rs:
        Fixed Issue 235 reported by ktakashi19:
            Aux syntaxes from (rnrs records syntactic) were not correctly
            renamed with rnrs identifier rename feature.

    Libraries:
        (match): 
            List match pattern like (x ... y) was not allowed.
