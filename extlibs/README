This directory includes some library distribution for convenience.

 - gc - Boehm GC
      For: autotools, CMake

      Boehm GC is (currently) only GC for Mosh and is always used.

      Slightly patched :
         misc.c => gc_misc.c renamed.
         gc_priv.h workarounded with HAVE_CONFIG_H and GC_INLINE definition
         Cygwin workaround at gc_cpp.h was commented out.

 - onig-5.9.2 - oniguruma
      For: CMake, MonaOS

      Oniguruma is regular expression library.
      This won't used at all in autotools(configure) builds.
      Please install oniguruma development package (like `onigruma-devel`)
      and see if `onig-config` command exists for autotools build.

      Slightly patched, see : http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nurse/20100826
